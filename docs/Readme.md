# json-ui-project

# Summary

Consider a CMS(Content Management System) where you can build UIs with drag &
drop UI components. CMS generates a JSON and react project has to render UI as
in the screenshot.

# Goal

You need to come up with a JSON structure and build a react project which
includes ui components from the screenshot.

# List of Components

- Input
- Dropdown
- Text
- Container (Container component might include other components or another
  container inside of it)
- etc.

# JSON structure

- I should be able to pass style to every component from JSON.
- I should be able to pass component attributes from JSON (ex: href, src).
- etc.

# Example

- example folder has data.json and data.png which you can check and understand
  how it worsk

# Result

This task is a little bit ambiguous and we want to know how you would do this.
Feel free to use any global state management like redux or context.
